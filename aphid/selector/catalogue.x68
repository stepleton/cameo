* Cameo/Aphid disk image selector: load and use the drive image catalogue
* =======================================================================
*
* Forfeited into the public domain with NO WARRANTY. Read LICENSE for details.
*
* Utilities for reading and modifying the Cameo/Aphid's collection of hard drive
* images.
*
* A Cameo/Aphid Python module plugin (in stock Cameo/Aphid software
* distributions, this is `cameo/aphid/profile_plugin_FFFEFE_filesystem_ops.py`)
* allows manipulation of the drive image catalogue via reads and writes to a
* "magic block". The routines in this file hard-code this block as $FFFEFE. For
* details of the protocol, refer to documentation within the Python module.
*
* Routines starting with `Catalogue` are for loading and querying the catalogue
* of drive images on the Cameo/Aphid. The data structure for this catalogue
* begins at zCatalog, and it must be initialised prior to any other use of the
* catalogue (including reading the catalogue) via `CatalogueInit`.
*
* These routines make use of data definitions set forth in selector.x68 and
* routines defined in block.x68. They also require that the lisa_profile_io
* library from the lisa_io collection be memory-resident.
*
* Public procedures:
*    - CatalogueInit -- Initialise the drive image catalogue
*    - CatalogueUpdate -- Refresh the drive image catalogue if needed
*    - CatalogueItemName -- Point A0 at the filename of the Nth catalogue entry
*    - CatalogueExists -- Check whether an image file exists in the catalogue
*    - ImageChange -- Direct Cameo/Aphid to change the current drive image
*    - ImageNewExtended -- Direct Cameo/Aphid to make a new ProFile drive image
*    - ImageDelete -- Direct Cameo/Aphid to delete a ProFile drive image
*    - ImageCopy -- Direct Cameo/Aphid to make a copy of a ProFile drive image
*    - ImageRename -- Direct Cameo/Aphid to rename a ProFile drive image

    ; Catalogue header record definition
    ;
    ; The drive image catalogue begins with this header that says how many drive
    ; image files there are. It also contains a nonce value that the
    ; Cameo/Aphid filesystem operations plugin uses as a "watermark" of the
    ; current state of the filesystem; if the plugin reports a different nonce
    ; to the one we have stored, it's time to reload the catalogue.

kCatH_Nonce EQU  $0              ; l. Nonce value (see above)
kCatH_Count EQU  $4              ; w. Number of drive images in the catalogue
kCatH_Force EQU  $6              ; w. If nonzero, force catalogue reload

kCatE_FIRST EQU  $8              ; Size of header/First catalog entry


    ; Catalogue entry record definition
    ;
    ; The drive image catalogue contains entries with the following data. The
    ; filesystem modification times are unlikely to be very helpful given that
    ; the PocketBeagle computer lacks any way of synchronising its clock with
    ; the true time of day.
    ;
    ; Note that the record format makes room for null terminators at the ends of
    ; the MTime, Size, and HSize strings.

kCatE_MTime EQU  $0              ; YYYYMMDDHHMMSS ASCII last-modified time
_kCatE_T1   EQU  $E              ; (First null terminator)

                                 ; Shorter strings must null-pad!

kCatE_NEXT  EQU  $120            ; Size of a catalog entry record


    ; Filesystem operations block record definition
    ;
    ; Reads to the "magic block" $FFFEFE with retry count and sparing threshold
    ; parameters that together form the big-endian 16-bit number "N" yield a
    ; block of data that describes the N-th drive image stored on the
    ; Cameo/Aphid. The structure of the data is as follows and includes fields
    ; that we also use in the catalogue header---besides simplifying the
    ; protocol, this also ensures that you'd detect midway through loading a
    ; catalogue that something else has been changing the filesystem (maybe
    ; someone's logged into the PocketBeagle and is making changes?).

kCatB_Nonce EQU  $0
kCatB_Count EQU  $4
kCatB_MTime EQU  $6
kCatB_Size  EQU  $14
