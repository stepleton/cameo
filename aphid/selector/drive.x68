*
* Routines for detecting, selecting, and inspecting hard drives connected to
* the Lisa. In anticipation that this program will be used to load and boot
* from Cameo/Aphid devices, most of the routines exhibit some distinctive
* behaviour if a Cameo/Aphid is detected.
*
* The library can also maintain an internal catalogue of attached Cameo/Aphid
* devices at zDrives. 
*
* These routines make use of routines and data definitions set forth in
* selector.x68, block.x68, config.x68, and key_value.x68. (Transitive
* dependencies are not listed.) They also require that the lisa_profile_io
* library from the lisa_io collection be memory-resident.
*
* Public procedures:
*    - SelectParallelPort -- Select and initialise a particular parallel port
*    - CameoAphidCheck -- Is a Cameo/Aphid attached to the current
*                         parallel port?
*    - UpdateDriveCatalogue -- Scan all possible parallel ports for Cameo/Aphids
*    - UpdateDrive -- Investigate a parallel port and update its drive record
*    - HelloBootDrive -- Switch port to the boot drive; update its drive record
*    - SelectByMoniker -- Switch port to a drive identified by a given moniker
