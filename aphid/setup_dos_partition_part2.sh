# Together with setup_dos_partition_part1.sh, this shell script puts a fat32
# partition in spare space on your microSD card, establishes a mount point for
# it, and modifies /etc/fstab to mount the partition automatically. Usage:
#
#    setup_dos_partition_part2.sh
#
# This script continues the setup process that setup_dos_partition_part1.sh
# begins. Before running this script, you should have run that script and
# rebooted your PocketBeagle.
#
# This script must be run with superuser privileges.

#### CONFIGURATION ####

DEVICE='/dev/mmcblk0'                     # Should be the SD card.
MOUNT_POINT='/usr/local/lib/cameo-aphid'  # The Aphid images directory.


#### SAFETY CHECKS #####

# Check for the presence of the file that indicates that we're picking up where
# we left off from the previous script.
