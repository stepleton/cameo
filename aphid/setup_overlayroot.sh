# This shell script enables overlayroot filesystem protection for the root
# filesystem---the last step in setting up your Cameo/Aphid stack as an
# embedded appliance. With this option enabled, no changes to the root
# filesystem will be saved to the microSD card---instead, changes are only
# saved to RAM and will be lost whenever the PocketBeagle is shut down or
# rebooted. Cameo/Aphid drive images must reside on a second disk partition
# that does not have overlayroot protection; the setup_dos_partition* scripts
# prepare such a partition for you.
#
# Before running this script, you should have run all of the other setup
# scripts and completed the installation of the Cameo/Aphid software.
#
# This script must be run with superuser privileges.
